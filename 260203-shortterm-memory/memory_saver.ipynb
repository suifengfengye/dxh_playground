Since the user provided their name, maybe I should call get_user_info to retrieve more details about Bob. However, the function's description says it looks up user info, but there's no parameters specified. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to use the user's name from the context? But the parameters are empty. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the tool definition. Since the function doesn't take arguments, I can't pass Bob's name to it. Maybe the function is intended to be used without parameters, but in this case, the user provided their name. I should call the function anyway, even if it doesn't use the name.
